To complete the app, you'll need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or icon generator. Here are some options:

1. Use an online icon generator like:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.canva.com/

2. Create a simple icon with text "P+P" on a blue background (#3498db)

3. Use an emoji-based icon with ðŸ’ª (flexed biceps) emoji

4. Use a free icon from a site like:
   - https://www.flaticon.com/
   - https://www.iconfinder.com/
   - https://thenounproject.com/

Once created, place these icon files in the same directory as your index.html file.

These icons will be used for:
- App icon when installed on home screen
- Favicon in browser
- Splash screen when the app is launched
